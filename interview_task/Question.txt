FIS Technical Test


Write a Python(3.6+) program which should read content from an input file and produce a text
report containing the following information:
 The total wordcount
 Total of unique words
 The top 10 words based on their word count, showing the word and how many times it
appeared.
The following should be noted.
 The program should have one mandatory parameter (the input file name). The program
should stop and report an error if the mandatory parameter is not specified, or if the
specified input file name does not exist. Sample input file attached for the reference.
Program should work for any text file.
 It has 1 optional parameter (the output file name). if this is not specified, the output file
produced should be hardcoded as “wc_report.txt”
 The program should ignore any punctuation, such as commas, full stops, quotation marks
etc. It should only be counting words.
 Hyphenated (-) words should be treated as a single word.
 The “top 10” results should be shown in descending order based upon their word count.
 The program should be case insensitive. i.e. Hello and HELLO are counted as the same word.
Sample Input file

alice.txt
